## The makeup of RDS Blocks
RDS Blocks are the equivalent to repeatable components in other design systems. They are the building blocks for interfaces across Carleton's domain. While ultimately they are made up of data, settings, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the secret ingredient for making RDS blocks is <span class="u-icon u-icon-text" aria-hidden="true">{%include "icons/heart.svg"%}</span> love. 

### What does making blocks with love mean?

It means:

- All blocks need to be crafted in a meticulous manner with a focus on accessibility, clean, semantic markup and lean CSS styles while following the design system standards guiding their creation and use.
- All blocks need to go through a Release Management process where they are well-tested on all browsers and platforms. Multi-step code reviews and quality assurance are required before any block can be released in the wild.
- All blocks need to be documented and commented enough to be easily integrated and expandable in future.

## Blocks 
  Blocks make up a distinct section of an interface. Functionally independent, __a block can NOT be nested within another block__. They can, however, consist of components. For the most part, they stack on top of each other as each block occupies its own row. RDS layouts are subdivided into blocks, some of them containing components.
