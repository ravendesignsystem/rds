# RDS v1.0.0

Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore...

## Getting Started

### Clone repo

Clone this repo https://github.com/ravendesignsystem/rds.git into your project directory.

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have composer, node and npm installed.

Check if they are installed and what version is installed. If either is not installed, used the link provided to get documentation on how to install them.

* `composer --version` Read more about [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
* `node --version` -- Read more about [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* `npm --version` -- NPM is install as a part of Node.js

#### Install packages

After confirming the dependencies above are installed, you need to install the required packages, coming from the `package.json` and the `composer.json` files.

* `npm install` -- this installs all the dependencies set in the package.json file
* `composer install` -- this installs all the dependencies set in the composer.json file

## Running RDS Locally

Both of the following commands need to run simultaneously, so open two terminal windows for them.

* `npm run sculpin` -- run sculpin static site generator, [read more](https://sculpin.io)
* `npm run watch` -- run the laravel mix watch task, [read more](https://laravel-mix.com)
