# Raven Design System (RDS)

RDS, Carleton University‚Äôs design system, is a living digital organism uniting campus wide teams around a common visual language.

**Note**: the instructions below are for developing RDS and its documentation. For building projects with RDS, the latest documentation can be found at https://ravendesignsystem.github.io/rds/.

## Setting Up

1. Clone project:

    ```git clone https://github.com/ravendesignsystem/rds.git foldername```

2. Install [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io) with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):
   
   ```php composer.phar install```

3. Install project NPM packages
   ```npm install```

4. If you are deploying releases, add a .en file based on the example .env file:
   
   ```cp ./.env-example ./.env```
   
   Contact a RDS core contributor to get the info for the `.env` file.

## Working Locally

1. Create a feature branch from the `develop` branch:
   
   ```git checkout -b feature_name develop```

2. Build the static files, set a watch task and launch BrowserSync by running the npm script:
   
   ```npm run watch```

3. üôè make small, single-purpose commits often with clear messages. 

## Publishing Changes

1. Compile the static files for production by running the npm script:
   
   ```npm run prod```

2. Commit all changes:
   
   ```git commit -am "A clear message"```

3. Push branch to Github

   ```git push origin $feature_name```

4. Squash and merge your feature branch into the develop branch.
5. Delete the feature branch.
6. Merge the `develop` branch into `master`.

## Stop Sculpin Server

In order to fully stop the watch task and sculpin server, you need to do more than stop the script. Once that is stopped, to the following:

* `sudo lsof -i tcp:8000` - get the PID of the sculpin task and make note of it
* `kill -9 PID` - replace PID with the number from the step above
## Releases
